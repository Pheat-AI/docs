title: Navigation Basics
---

Remade uses an infinite canvas, which means you can add as much content within, and scroll both vertically and horizontally. Here's how to navigate around your canvas.

## Zooming

There two ways to zoom in and out on your canvas:

- **Scroll with your mouse** - Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- **Pinch using your trackpad** - Use two fingers to pinch in/out on your trackpad

## Panning

To move across the canvas, known as panning:

- If you're using a mouse, the easiest way is to use **middle click** (press down the scroll wheel) and drag.
- Hold <kbd>Space</kbd> to temporarily activate the hand tool, then click, hold, and drag. While holding <kbd>Space</kbd>, your cursor will switch from select mode to pan mode as indicated by the hand cursor.
- Select the hand tool at the top of the canvas. Then click, hold, and drag.
