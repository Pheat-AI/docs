## Extending a Video

Create longer-form content by seamlessly connecting multiple video generations:

1. **Select Video** – Select a video and click "Extend" from the video options.
2. **Automatic Frame Extraction** – The final frame of your selected video is automatically added as the first frame in the generation toolbar.
3. **Generate Continuation** – Use the same model you used for the original video to ensure a consistent style and frame rate, then generate a new video that picks up right where the last one ended.
4. **Repeat as Needed** – Continue this process to build longer scenes, fluid transitions, or full narrative sequences.
