## How to Share a Canvas

To share a canvas with others, click the share button in the top right corner of the canvas, switch your canvas visibility to public, copy the generated shareable link, and send the link to anyone you want to give access to.

  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  **Important:** When you receive a canvas, click "Make a Copy" in the top right
  corner to add this canvas to your workspace and be able to edit and generate
  new content. Without making a copy, you can only view the shared canvas but
  cannot make modifications.
