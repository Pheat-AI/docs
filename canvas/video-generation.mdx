- **Use a start frame** - Adding a start frame helps conserve credits, as generating images is faster and cheaper. Starting with a great image can significantly enhance your video creation process.
- **Use clear references** - High-quality reference images produce better video results.
- **Experiment with frame types** - Try different combinations of start frames, end frames, and references.
- **Make sure to inspect the enhanced prompt** - Sometimes, enhancing the prompt might include details that you don't want.
