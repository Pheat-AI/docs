# Testing Your LoRA

After your LoRA training job completes, you'll want to test the results to evaluate performance and select the best epoch. This section guides you through the testing process.

## Accessing Training Jobs

Navigate to the Training Jobs section using the top navigation bar.

</Frame>

## Viewing Training Jobs

In the Training Jobs section, you'll see a list of all your training jobs:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/lora/training-jobs-list.png" alt="Training jobs list" />
</Frame>

Currently, there is no real-time training progress indicator, but epochs are saved and displayed as soon as they complete. You can expand a job to see if any epochs are available while the job is still training.

## Completed Training Jobs

When a job is complete, you'll be able to:

</Frame>

- Download individual epochs
- View the training configuration
- Access the training data
- Resume training from a specific checkpoint
- Test the best epochs

## Testing Epochs

To test your trained LoRA, click the "Test Best Epoch" button. This will open a testing configuration modal:

</Frame>

In this modal, you can:
- Select which epochs you'd like to test
- Enter prompts to use for testing
- Adjust inference parameters

## Configuring Your Test

Complete the testing modal with your preferred settings:

</Frame>

When you're ready, click the "Submit Test Request" button to launch the test.

## Viewing Test Results

After submitting your test request, navigate to the Testing tab to view your testing jobs:

</Frame>

## Evaluating Results

Review the results of your testing job to determine which epoch performs best for your use case:

</Frame>

Compare the outputs from different epochs with various prompts to identify which one best captures your intended concept.

## Next Steps

After identifying the best epoch, you can:
1. Download the model for use in your projects
2. Share your LoRA with the community
3. Continue iterating on your training process with new data or parameters
