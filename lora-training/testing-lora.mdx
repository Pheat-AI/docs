After your LoRA training job completes, you'll want to test the results to evaluate performance and select the best epoch. This section guides you through the testing process.

## Accessing Training Jobs

Navigate to the Training Jobs section using the top navigation bar.

## Completed Training Jobs

When a job is complete, you'll be able to:

- Download individual epochs
- View the training configuration
- Download the training data with captions
- Resume training from the latest checkpoint
- Test the best epochs

</Frame>

In this modal, you can:
- Select which epochs you'd like to test
- Enter prompts to use for testing
- Adjust inference parameters
- Automatically generate test prompts

## Configuring Your Test

Complete the testing modal with your preferred settings:

</Frame>

When you're ready, click the "Submit Test Request" button to launch the test.

## Viewing Test Results

After submitting your test request, you can view your testing jobs:

Review the results of your testing job to determine which epoch performs best for your use case:

</Frame>

Compare the outputs from different epochs with various prompts to identify which one best captures your intended concept.

## Next Steps

After identifying the best epoch, you can:
1. Download the model for use in your projects
2. Share your LoRA on platforms like CivitAI/TensorArt
3. Let us know and we'll add it to Discord!
