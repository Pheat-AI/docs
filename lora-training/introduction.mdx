Welcome to the Remade LoRA Trainer! This guide will walk you through the process of training LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models on our platform. LoRA is a technique that allows you to efficiently fine-tune large video models for specific effects/styles/characters etc.

## Overview of the Training Process

Training a LoRA model on our platform involves three main steps:

1. **Sourcing Your Dataset**: Selecting high-quality, consistent data that clearly represents what you want your LoRA to learn.

2. **Uploading Data**: Uploading your dataset to our platform and configuring preprocessing settings.

3. **Launching Training**: Configuring and starting your LoRA training job.

The following sections will guide you through each step in detail.
