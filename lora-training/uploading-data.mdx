After [sourcing your dataset](/lora-training/sourcing-dataset), the next step is to upload it to our platform for processing. This section walks you through the process.

## Accessing the Upload Page

Navigate to the Upload page using the top navigation bar of the platform.

## Uploading Your Files

On the Upload page, you'll see an interface for uploading your data files:

You can:

- Click to browse and select files from your device
- Upload multiple files simultaneously


As your files upload, you'll see progress indicators for each file and an overall progress bar. Wait for all files to complete uploading before proceeding to the next step.

After selecting your data, you'll configure the processing settings:

### Model Type
Select the type of model to prepare the data for:
- Hunyuan
- Wan

### Trigger Phrase (NEEDS WORK)
Enter a token (trigger word) that will be used to invoke your LoRA after training. For best results:
- Use rare words or unique combinations to avoid conflicts
- A common approach is to replace vowels with numbers (e.g., "Pixar Style" â†’ "p1x4r_styl3")

### Captioning Model System Prompt
Enter a system prompt for the captioning model that will be used to generate descriptions for your media. An example is provided that you can modify to fit your needs.

When you're satisfied with your settings, click "Start Processing" to begin preparing your data for training.




## Viewing Processing Jobs

After starting processing, you'll be redirected to the processing jobs page. Here you can monitor all your data processing jobs:

This page shows:
- Progress of current processing jobs
- Status indicators for each job
- Options to expand jobs to view details

<Note>
Processing longer videos may take more time. The progress tracker will keep you informed of the current status.
</Note>
<Warning>
If you don't refresh the page after a job is complete, you may not see all the training data.
