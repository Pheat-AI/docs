# Sourcing Your Dataset

The quality and specificity of your dataset directly determine the effectiveness of your trained LoRA. This section provides guidance on how to build a dataset that will produce good results.

## Define Your Goal

Before collecting data, clearly identify what you want your LoRA to achieve. Your goal might be:

- A specific motion style (dance movements, walking style)
- A clothing or visual style
- Character appearance or behavior
- Environmental or scene characteristics

The more specific your objective, the better your dataset will perform.

## Selecting Content

### Consistency

Choose videos or images that clearly and consistently demonstrate the action, style, or elements you want your LoRA to learn. Consistency is crucial for the model to recognize patterns effectively.

### Quality

When selecting media for your dataset, prioritize:
- Clear visuals
- Stable lighting conditions
- Minimal artifacts
- Higher resolution content

Avoid blurry, pixelated, or overly compressed media as these can introduce unwanted artifacts into your trained model.

### Specificity

Limit each dataset to a single concept or motion to avoid confusion in the training process. If you need multiple variations, prepare separate datasets for each variation.

### Diversity Within Bounds

While maintaining consistency in your core concept, include slight variations in:
- Angles
- Backgrounds
- Scenarios

This controlled diversity helps the model generalize better while maintaining focus on the specific elements you want it to learn.

## Dataset Size

For most LoRA training purposes:
- Start with datasets containing 10-20 videos/images
- You can use more data for more complex concepts or better results, but this will increase training time
- Quality is generally more important than quantity

## Framerate and Resolution

Our platform automatically handles technical aspects like optimal framerate and resolution for processing your data. You don't need to preprocess your media files in these dimensions.

<Tip>
For best results, focus on selecting media that clearly demonstrates your target concept rather than worrying about technical specifications.

## Next Steps

Once you've prepared your dataset according to these guidelines, you're ready to [upload your data](/lora-training/uploading-data) to the platform.
